# Real-Time-Event-MS
A user-friendly web application built with React.js or Angular. This application allows users to create events, send invitations, track RSVPs, and interact with other attendees in real-time.

### Real-Time Event Management System

#### **Architecture Overview**

- **Frontend (Tier 1)**: 
  - A user-friendly web application built with React.js or Angular. This application allows users to create events, send invitations, track RSVPs, and interact with other attendees in real-time.
  - Features include event creation, calendar integration, guest list management, and live chat for event participants.
  
- **Backend (Tier 2)**:
  - A Node.js or Django REST API that handles user authentication, event management, real-time updates, and communication between the frontend and the database.
  - WebSocket or similar technology (e.g., Socket.io) will be used for real-time communication, such as updating RSVPs, sending notifications, and enabling live chat.

- **Database (Tier 3)**:
  - A PostgreSQL or MongoDB database for storing event details, user information, RSVP statuses, chat history, and other relevant data.
  - Redis could be used as a caching layer for real-time data to ensure quick access and responsiveness.

#### **DevOps Focus**

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Implement CI/CD using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI to automate the building, testing, and deployment processes. 
  - Use Docker to containerize the frontend, backend, and database components.
  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
  - Use Terraform or AWS CloudFormation to manage infrastructure on AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
  - This would include setting up Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), subnets, load balancers, and database instances.

- **Orchestration and Deployment**:
  - Deploy the application using Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestration, with Helm charts to manage K8s resources.
  - Consider using a managed Kubernetes service like AWS EKS, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
  - Implement autoscaling and load balancing to handle varying loads, especially during event peak times.

- **Monitoring and Logging**:
  - Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring application performance, including metrics like response times, error rates, and resource usage.
  - Implement centralized logging using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a cloud-based solution like AWS CloudWatch.
  - Set up alerting mechanisms to notify the DevOps team of any issues in real-time.

- **Security**:
  - Implement security best practices such as using HTTPS, managing secrets with tools like HashiCorp Vault, and setting up proper IAM roles.
  - Use tools like OWASP ZAP or SonarQube to perform security testing and vulnerability scanning during the CI/CD pipeline.

- **Backup and Disaster Recovery**:
  - Set up automated backups for the database, and ensure that they are stored securely.
  - Implement disaster recovery plans, such as multi-region deployment or cross-zone replication, to ensure high availability and resilience.

This project would involve various technologies and tools, providing hands-on experience with full-stack development, containerization, cloud deployment, and modern DevOps practices.
